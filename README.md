# StoreSales

## This project is based Sales of various stores taking into consideration the amount of customers that come in daily, store area, items available and store sales.

# The aim of this project is to compare the difference in sales of the stores and the factors affecting it.

# Data Preparation
## The data seemed clean because there were no missing values, duplicates and outliers to take care of.

# Data Analysis and Visualization
## Used visualizations to find and define relationships between variables.
## Used .corr() function to find the correlation between variables of which most were lesser than 1.
## Analyzing the data further, some averages and totals were found.

# Interpretation
## The Store Area determined the available items at the store all other variables were independent of the other.
## Across all stores each customer did not spend more than $45480 per day and $136440 per month.

# Recommendations
* More data can be collected on items that makes each store different. 
* The location of the stores, whether there are more than one in an area.
* Data on customer ratings and feedback will also be helpful.

## These recommendations will help get more insights from the data.
